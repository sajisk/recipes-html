    <h3>The Indian Sabudana Kichadi </h3>

    <p> Sabudana khichri is an Indian dish made from soaked sabudana (tapioca pearls).[1] It is typically prepared in
        Indian states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat. In major towns
        like Mumbai, Pune, Indore, Bhopal, Jaipur and Nagpur, it is available as street food and is widely eaten
        throughout the year.</p>

    <p>It is the dish of choice when an individual observes a "fast" during Shivratri, Navratri, or a similar Hindu
        religious occasion. Sabudana khichri is one of the most popular comfort foods in India. It is often served with
        crunchy roasted peanuts and sautéed with potatoes using spices with generous squeeze of lemon. It has a chewy
        texture and takes on the taste of its accompaniments. It is known as sabudana usal in the Vidarbha region of
        Maharashtra.</p>
